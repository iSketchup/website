        <p> I'm Luis and I would dare to call myself a gamer. <br>
            I have been playing Video Games for more than half of my life, wich is with my age of 14 years pretty
            impressive. <br>
            That's also the reason I think I am qualified to talk about a game like Cyberpunk 2077
