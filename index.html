        <P>
            Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction in a dystopian futuristic setting <br>
            that tends to focus on a "combination of lowlife and high tech", featuring <br>
            futuristic technological and scientific achievements, such as artificial <br>
            intelligence and cybernetics, juxtaposed with societal collapse, dystopia or decay.
